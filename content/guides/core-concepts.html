<h1>Core User Guide: Concepts</h1>

<h2 id="Terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p> Throughout the library we use the terms
</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>node</em> as a synonym for vertex and</li>
	<li><em>edge</em> as a generic term for arc, line or hyperedge</li>
	<li><em>element</em> to cover nodes and edges.</li>
</ul>
<p> When dealing elements, we distinguish between
</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>outer elements</em> that you create and pass to the graph to be included.
			The types of the outer elements correspond to the type parameters of your graph,
			so outer nodes have the type <code>N</code>, outer edges have the type <code>E[N]</code>.</li>
	<li><em>inner elements</em> that are created by the graph on addition internally.
			They wrap the outer elements to enrich them by contextual information.
			For instance an inner node also knows about the neighbours of the outer node it wraps.
			Inner elements have path-dependent types: Given a graph <code>g</code>,
			inner nodes have the type <code>g.NodeT</code> while inner edges have the type <code>g.EdgeT</code>.
			For a mnemonic remember that we call them "inner" elements because their type is an inner class.</li>
</ul>
<p> For brevity, we call a graph
</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>generic</em> if its edge type is a class with a parametrized type for nodes like <code>DiEdge[Int]</code>.
		<code>DiEdge</code> is generic with respect to the type of nodes it may connect.
	</li>
	<li><em>typed</em> if its edge type is a class with no type parameter like <code>Flight</code>.
			<code>Flight</code> is typed with respect to the type of nodes it connects which is <code>Airport</code>.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="MutableImmutable">Mutable and Immutable Graphs</h2>
<p>	Both a mutable and an immutable implementation are at your disposal.
</p>
<p>	Unlike with standard collections it is not meaningful to use the immutable implementation by default because,
		unfortunately, its underlying data structure is not yet persistent.
		This means you need to carefully consider the <a href="/guides/core-characteristics.html">run-time characteristics</a>
		of the immutable implementation along with <a href="/guides/core-characteristics.html#BestPractices">best practices</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="Types">Types of Graphs</h2>
<p>	Graphs are defined by
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">trait Graph[N, E <: Edge[N]]
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><code>N&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> the type of nodes</li>
	<li><code>E&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> the type of edges.</li>
</ul>
<p>	Based on the four edge categories
</p>
<ul>
	<li>directed</li>
	<li>undirected</li>
	<li>directed hyperedge</li>
	<li>hyperedge</li>
</ul>
<p> we support
</p>
<ul>
	<li>directed graphs</li>
	<li>undirected graphs</li>
	<li>directed hypergraphs</li>
	<li>hypergraphs</li>
	<li>mixed graphs with arbitrary sets of edge types</li>
	<li>multigraphs with arbitrary multiplicity between nodes, and also</li>
	<li>graphs with loops.</li>
</ul>
<p> While nodes are labeled by nature, edges may be labeled or not.
<p> You control the type of the graph by determining the edge type.
		You can use the provided edge classes to create generic graphs.
		However, it is often beneficial to roll out your own ADT of edges to constrain edge usage with respect to
		which nodes they are allowed to connect and what kind of labels they have.
		This will make your graphs more type safe, hence the term <em>typed graph</em>.
</p>
<p>	Graphs are not constrained other than by the type parameters <code>N</code> and <code>E[N]</code>.
		This means that, currently, you yourself need to ensure that you graph which is, for instance,
		supposed to represent a DAG, is really a DAG.
</p>

<h2 id="PropertyGraphs">Relation to Property Graphs</h2>
<p>	<em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> is superior to the popular
	<a href="http://graphdatamodeling.com/Graph%20Data%20Modeling/GraphDataModeling/page/PropertyGraphs.html">Property Graph Model</a>
	in that
</p>
<ol>
	<li>you can not only associate nodes and edges with properties but, by rolling out your specific ADT of edges,
			you have full control over which nodes may be connected by what kind of edges.
			Of course, every edge type in your ADT, usually represented by a <code>case class</code>,
			will go with its distinct set of "properties".
	</li>
	<li>In contrast to representing properties by generic maps of the type <code>Map[String, Any]</code>,
			your graph becomes type safe thanks to the ability to accept your specific edge classes with properly typed fields.
	</li>
</ol>
<p> As an example, you can properly represent RDF with <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em>
	while the Property Graph model is less suitable for this purpose.
</p>

<h2 id="EdgeClasses">Edge Classes</h2>
<p>	All possible non-labeled as well as weighted edge classes are available out of the box
		but for labeled edges you need to define your edge class yourself.
		This is pretty straightforward based on the provided abstract classes and mix ins.
		You will find plenty of examples paving your way.
</p>
<p>	Weighted edges are just specific labeled ones so why did we provide them? We did so because
</p>
<ul>
	<li>with weights having the label type <code>Double</code> you now have ready-made edge classes for this use case
	</li>
	<li>they also serve as an example how to fine tune edge classes.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>	Since the edge set of a graph is represented by a hash set, edge equality determines
		if a specific edge may be added to the graph.
	  When defining your edge classes remember to mix in <code>MultiEdge</code> if you need multi-graph support.
</p>
<p>	To achieve light-weight, unified syntax, it's a good idea to also add infix constructor and extractor support
		to your edge classes. Mix ins and examples help you to also get this right in minutes.
</p>
<p>	Finally you might wonder why there is no direct support for labeled edges. The reason is that
</p>
<ul>
	<li>apart from weights, label types depend on your use case.
			It would be awkward to expect you to use <code>label: Any</code> instead of facilitating the definition
		  of your edge classes with properly named and typed fields fitting your needs.
	</li>
	<li>If we added a third type parameter for edge labels, what is also an option,
			the graph still would not know about different labels for different edges in a mixed graph on type level.
			A type parameter for labels would only help in case of graphs that contain edges with a single type of label.
	</li>
	<li>When having a label type parameter, it would also be necessary to add new editing methods or
			change the signature of the existing graph editing methods to allow for passing labels.
			This would increase complexity.
	</li>
</ul>
