<h1>Core User Guide: Initializing Graphs</h1>
<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p> The downloadable binaries are named
	<code>Graph-&lt;module&gt;_&lt;Scala-version&gt;-&lt;Graph-version&gt;.jar</code>
	following the Scala convention. For each <code>&lt;module&gt;</code> (here:
	<code>core</code>) there is a separate User Guide. To run the examples in the current
	documentation ensure that <code>Graph-core_*.jar</code> is on your class path.
</p>
<p>	In most cases you need to import the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">import scalax.collection.Graph // or scalax.collection.mutable.Graph
import scalax.collection.GraphPredef._, scalax.collection.GraphEdge._
</pre>
<h2>Type Parameters</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">trait Graph[N, E[X] <: EdgeLikeIn[X]]
</pre>
<p> <code>N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> is the type of the nodes of a graph instance.
</p>
<p> <code>E[X]</code> is the kind of type (also: higher kinded type) of edges of a graph
	instance.
</p>
<p> The trait <code>Graph</code> and most related templates have two type
	parameters: one for the contained nodes and one for the kind of contained edges.
	<code>Graph</code> doesn't impose any restriction on the type of nodes
	meaning that for the upper bound of the node type parameter any type
	including <code>Any</code> may be chosen. In contrast, the type parameter
	for edges is required to have at least the upper bound <code>EdgeLikeIn</code>.
</p>
<p> When selecting between the predefined edge types it might help
	you to understand their inheritance relationships:</p>
<figure>
	<img alt="Edge Type Hierarchy"
		src="/img/guides/core/EdgeTypeHierarchy.jpg">
	<figcaption>Diagram: Edge Type Hierarchy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> All edge classes derive from <code>trait EdgeLike</code> and, optionally, from
	<code>trait DiEdgeLike</code>. There are four <em>edge categories</em>:
	hyperedge, directed hyperedge, undirected and directed edge.
	Each of these categories has predefined edge classes representing any combination
	of non-weighted, weighted (<code>W</code>), key-weighted (<code>Wk</code>),
	labeled (<code>L</code>) and key-labeled (<code>Lk</code>).
	See <em>2.3 Edge Factories</em> for examples and more details.
</p>
<p> Based on the above inheritance hierarchy, graph types in the sense of
	graph theory are governed by the edge type parameter <code>E[X]</code>
	as follows:
</p>

	</tr>
	<tr><td>Simple</td>
		<td>only undirected edges without multi-edges</td>
		<td><code>UnDiEdge</code> or any of its variants <code>W*</code>,
			<code>L*</code> or <code>WL*</code> where the user is responsible

			she to do so
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Mixed</td>
		<td>more than one type of edges without multi-edges</td>

		<td>edges with the special label <code>weight</code>

		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Multi
		</td>
		<td>One or more edge types with multi-edges</td>
		<td>any of the predefined edge classes containing <code>K</code> in its prefix
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p> There is no constraint on the node type, but you should be especially careful when
	designing mutable nodes: <code>equals</code>/<code>hashCode</code> must be constant
	over their lifetime. This is because the behavior of hash-based collections is not
	specified if the value of an element is changed in a manner that affects equals
	comparisons - see
	<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Map.html">
	java.util.Map</a>.
	(Having ill-designed mutable nodes, you are still able to find them in the graph
	by calling <code>find</code> or <code>filter</code>, but these calls will cause
	a full scan.)

<p> Edge factories are simply <code>apply</code> methods of companion objects
	of edge classes. They are typically called whenever an edge is passed to a
	<code>Graph</code> method as an argument. The above table contains factory
	examples for some of the predefined edge classes.
</p>
<p> Apart from the four basic edge classes <code>[Di]HyperEdge</code> and
	<code>[Un]DiEdge</code> there are plenty of convenience edge class
	variants enabling easy creation of weighted and/or labeled edges:

<p> To bring the predefined weighted or labeled edge classes and the
	corresponding shortcuts into scope you need additional <code>import</code>s,
	for instance
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum"
>import scalax.collection.edge.LDiEdge     // labeled directed edge
import scalax.collection.edge.Implicits._ // shortcuts
</pre>
<p> While simple directed and undirected edge shortcuts may be used without
	parenthesis like <code>1 ~&gt; 2</code>, weighted and/or labeled edge shortcuts
	implicitly map to calls of functions with two parameter lists thus presuming
	parenthesis like <code>(1 ~+&gt; 2)(x)</code>.
</p>
<p>	Keyed edges (key-weighted and / or key-labeled edges) come into
	play whenever you are designing multi-edges. They ensure that, when
	calculating the hash-code of the edge, the hash-code of the keyed
	weight and / or that of the keyed label will be included in the
	hash-code calculation of the edge.
</p>
<p> Therefore, when utilizing any of the predefined key-labeled edge
	classes you are responsible to provide an appropriate label type. If
	your label is of a compound type in the sense that it is made up of
	several attributes you should carefully analyze which part of your
	label should become part of the edge key (hash-code). Unless the
	edge-key includes all parts of such a compound label you must override
	<code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> to reflect the real key-parts.
	For instance, when designing a <code>Flight</code> label for the predefined
	edge class <code>LkDiEdge</code>, you might observe, that only
	<code>flightNo</code> should be part of the edge key. Otherwise it would be
	possible to connect two airports with arcs showing to the same direction and
	with the same <code>flightNo</code> if the edges only differ in its
	<code>departure</code>. To cope with this problem you have to override
	<code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> as follows:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">case class Flight(val flightNo : String,
                  val departure: DayTime  = DayTime (0,0),
                  val duration : Duration = Duration(0,0))
{ override def equals(other: Any) = other match {
    case that: Flight => that.flightNo == this.flightNo
    case _            => false
  }
  override def hashCode = flightNo.##
}
</pre>
<p> (The full example is included in <code>TEdge.scala</code>.)
</p>
<p> Labeled edges will contain a reference to the label but graph instances
	do not know about the actual label type. This is why edges of the same
	graph instance are allowed to have different types by design. As a
	consequence, if you are utilizing a predefined edge class and want to
	call label methods, you need to <code>match</code> (cast down) the label
	value of the edge to your label type. This conversion is supported by the
	<code>trait LEdgeImplicits[L]</code>:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">case class MyLabel(val i: Int)
val eOuter = LUnDiEdge(1,3)(MyLabel(4))
val four_1 = eOuter.label.i // label must be dereferenced first

import scalax.collection.edge.LBase.LEdgeImplicits
object MyImplicit extends LEdgeImplicits[MyLabel]
import MyImplicit._
val four_2 = eOuter.i       // implicitly dereferenced
</pre>
<p> What is more, mutable <code>Graph</code> instances provide edge creation methods
	to be called directly on <code>Graph</code> instances (<code>addEdge</code>,
	<code>+~=</code>, <code>addAndGetEdge</code>) or on inner nodes
	(<code>connectWith</code>, <code>+~</code>). These methods should save execution
	time since less conversion is necessary to complete edge creation.

<h2>Instantiating Graphs</h2>

	<li>Creates an undirected graph of the type <code>Graph[Int,UnDiEdge]
		</code>with the node set <code>{1, 3, 5}</code> and the edge set {3~1}.
		The operator <code>~</code> is used to create undirected edges.
		N is inferred to be <code>Int</code> because both the edge ends
		and the single node are of type <code>Int</code>.
	</li>
	<li>Creates the very same directed graph as a). Operator <code>~</code>
		is just a short-hand for invoking the factory <code>UnDiEdge</code>.
	</li>
	<li>Creates a directed graph of the type <code>Graph[AnyVal,DiEdge]</code>
		with the node set <code>{3, 1.2}</code> and the edge set {3~&gt;1.2}.
		The operator <code>~&gt;</code> is used to create directed edges.
		N is inferred to be <code>AnyVal</code> because this is the smallest common
		super type of the edge ends.
	</li>
	<li>Creates a hypergraph of the type <code>Graph[Int,HyperEdge]
		</code>with the node set <code>{1, 2, 3}</code> and the edge set {1~1, 1~2~3}.
		In <code>1~2~3</code> the second <code>~</code> operator creates
		an undirected hyperedge because the left operand is already an edge.
	</li>
	<li value="6">Creates an instance of<code> Graph[Airport,LkDiEdge]</code>

		<code>~+#&gt;</code> is an edge factory shortcut to pass the labels.
		The <code>Flight</code> attributes are flight number, departure time
		and flight duration. See also <em>2.3 Edge Factories</em>.

	<li value="11">Creates a <code>Graph</code> from the <code>Iterable</code>

<h2>Type Parameter Inference</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala linenums">val g = Graph()                // Graph[Nothing,Nothing]
val g = Graph(1)               // Graph[Int,Nothing]
val g = Graph(1~>2); g += 1.2  // Graph[Int,DiEdge]; compiler error
Graph(1~>2) + 2~3              // compiler error
</pre>
<p> Calling the default <code>Graph</code> factory without type parameters is in general
	satisfactory if at least one edge is passed. Otherwise, analogously to regular Scala
	collection members, you are advised to explicitly define the type parameters:
</p>
<p>As to</p>
<ol>
	<li>In absence of any arguments, <code>Nothing</code> is inferred for both the node
		and the edge type so you cannot add any nodes or edges to this instance later on.
	</li>
	<li>In absence of any edge arguments, <code>Nothing</code> is inferred for the
		edge type so you can add only nodes to this instance later on.
	</li>
	<li>To be able to add a <code>Double</code> to this instance, you must define
		its type parameters broader at creation time like <code>Graph[AnyVal,DiEdge]</code>.
		Also note that, due to the higher kinded nature of the <code>E[X]</code>
		type parameter, <code>DiEdge</code> is correctly inferred &#8211;
		even if some of you would expect <code>DiEdge[Int]</code>.
	</li>
	<li>This addition is rejected by the compiler because <code>[Int,DiEdge]</code>
		is inferred and <code>2~3</code> is not a directed but an undirected
		edge. Directed edges inherit from undirected edges but the opposite is
		not true.
	</li>
</ol>
<p> As a final note, whenever you are implementing own functionality on top
	of <code>Graph</code>, the Scala type system requires to declaratively
	maintain type parameter bounds as shown in the following example:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">def myFunction[N, E[X] <: EdgeLikeIn[X]](g: Graph[N,E])
</pre>
<h2>Implementations</h2>
<p> As common to members of <code>scala.collection</code>, <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em>
	comes with separate implementations for <em>immutable</em> and <em>mutable</em>
	<code>Graph</code>'s. For your convenience, the companion 	objects ensure
	the selection of an appropriate underlying default 	implementation
	so you normally don't have to take any specific action.
</p>
