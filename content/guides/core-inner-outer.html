<p>As to</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Int</code> and <code>UnDiEdge</code> are the concrete types for the node and edge type parameters.
	Here they are inferred from the <em>outer edge</em> being passed to the Graph factory.
</li>
<li>The node set contains inner nodes of the path dependent type <code>g.NodeT</code>.
	The node set does not guarantee any specific order of the contained nodes.
	See <em>4.2</em> for how to look up specific nodes.
</li>
<li><code>toOuter</code>, called on an inner node, returns the <em>outer node</em> of type <code>Int</code>.
</li>
<li>Elements of the edge set of the type <code>g.EdgeT</code> are so called <em>inner edges</em>.
</li>
<li><code>toOuter</code>, called on an inner edge, returns the <em>outer edge</em> of type <code>UnDiEdge</code>.
</li>
<li>Remarkably, the incident nodes of inner edges are inner nodes.
</li>
<li>Inner nodes like <code>n1</code> allow for calling both graph (<code>NodeT)</code> methods like <code>diSuccessors</code>...
</li>
<li>...and any method of the outer node type, here <code>%</code> of <code>Int</code>.
</li>
<li><code>toOuter</code> reconstructs the outer edge <code>1~2</code>;
	<code>g.edges.toEdgeInSet</code>&nbsp; would reconstruct all outer edges.
</li>
</ol>
<p>A basic understanding of inner and outer objects (nodes and edges) is essential for working with <code>Graph </code>efficiently. From the perspective of <code>Graph</code> we distinguish between</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Outer Nodes</em><br>
	Outer nodes exist outside of the context of any particular graph and must be provided by the library user.
	When added to a graph, they will be transparently wrapped by a corresponding inner node.
	Outer nodes must satisfy the upper bound of the node type parameter of the graph,
	being <code>Int</code> in the above example.
	Otherwise they will be rejected by the compiler. 
</li>
<li><em>Inner Nodes</em><br>
	Inner nodes are objects bound to a particular graph. They are transparently created on graph instantiation
	or on adding nodes to a graph. Inner nodes are instances of the inner class <code>NodeT</code>, hence
	the term, and are implementing the <code>InnerNodeLike</code> interface.
	An inner node acts as a container of the corresponding outer node also providing a wealth of graph functionality
	such as <code>diSuccessors</code> or <code>pathTo</code>.
	Inner nodes always equal to the contained, user-provided outer node thus facilitating interchangeability
	of inner and outer nodes in many situations.
	Note that <code>NodeT</code> is a path dependent type such as <code>g.NodeT</code>
	with <code>g</code> denoting a single graph instance.
</li>
<li><em>Outer Edges</em><br>
	Similarly, outer edges exist outside of the context of any particular graph.
	Usually they will be provided by the library user by implicit edge factory methods like <code>~</code>. 
	When added to a graph, they will be transparently wrapped by a corresponding inner edge.
	Outer edges must satisfy the upper bound of the edge type parameter of the graph,
	being <code>UnDiEdge</code> in the above example. Otherwise they will be rejected by the compiler.
	Note that <code>UnDiEdge</code> is, in contrast to <code>UnDiEdge[Int]</code>, a so called higher kinded type.
	Outer edge types must be derived from <code>EdgeLike</code>.
</li>
<li><em>Inner Edges</em><br>
	Last, inner edges are objects bound to a particular graph.
	They are transparently created on graph instantiation or on adding edges to a graph.
	Inner edges are instances of the inner class <code>EdgeT</code> and are implementing
	the <code>InnerEdgeLike</code> interface.
	An inner edge acts as a container of the corresponding outer edge adding graph functionality.
	Inner edges always equal to the contained, user-provided outer edge thus facilitating interchangeability
	of inner and outer edges.
	Note that <code>EdgeT</code> is a path dependent type such as <code>g.EdgeT</code>
	with <code>g</code> denoting a single graph instance.
