<p>As to</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Int</code> and <code>UnDiEdge</code> are the types of <em>outer nodes </em>and <em>outer edges</em> of <code>g</code> respectively.</li>
<li>Querying the first node of the node set is a means to show that the type of the inner node is <code>g.NodeT (head</code> does not guarantee a specific order). See <em>4.2</em> for how to look up nodes.</li>
<li>Similarly, the inner edge <code>e1</code> is of the type <code>g.EdgeT</code>.</li>
<li>Remarkably, the first incident node with <code>e1</code> is an inner node of the type <code>g.NodeT</code>.</li>
<li>On <code>n1</code> you can call both graph (<code>NodeT)</code> methods like <code>diSuccessors</code>...</li>
<li>...and any method of the outer node type, here <code>%</code> of <code>Int</code>.</li>
<li>Reconstructs the outer edge <code>1~2</code>; <code>g.edges.toEdgeInSet</code>&nbsp; would reconstruct all outer edges.</li>
</ol>
<p>A basic understanding of inner and outer objects (nodes and edges) is essential for working with <code>Graph </code>efficiently. From the perspective of <code>Graph</code> we distinguish between</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Outer Nodes</em><br>An outer node is roughly speaking an object satisfying the node upper type bound of a given graph. It may be contained in the node set or may not. When such an object is passed to a graph method, it will implicitly be converted to a node wrapper of the type <code>NodeIn</code>. Further, when adding to the node set of a graph, outer nodes are transparently converted to inner nodes.</li>
<li><em>Outer Edges</em><br>Similarly, an outer edge is an object satisfying the edge upper type bound of a given graph. Outer edges must inherit from <code>EdgeLike</code>. An outer edge is not coupled with any graph instance: It my be contained in the edge set of a graph or may not. Edge factories are responsible for correct typing. On adding to the edge set of a graph, outer edges are transparently converted to inner edges.</li>
<li><em>Inner Nodes</em><br>Inner nodes are instances of an inner class of the type <code>NodeT</code> implementing the <code>InnerNodeLike</code> interface. They actually wrap outer nodes providing a wealth of graph functionality such as <code>diSuccessors</code> or <code>pathTo</code>. At the same time you can interact with an inner node as if it was your original object.</li>
<li><em>Inner Edges</em><br>Similarly, inner edges are instances of an inner class of the type <code>EdgeT</code> implementing the <code>InnerEdgeLike</code> interface. They actually wrap outer edges providing a wealth of graph functionality. At the same time you can interact with an inner edge and its incident nodes as if they were your original objects.</li>
</ul>
