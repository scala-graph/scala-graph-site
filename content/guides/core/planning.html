<h1>Core User Guide: Plan Your Graph</h1>

<h2 id="NodesEdges">Nodes and edges</h2>
<p> Presumably, you go for graphs because you have <em>things</em> that are <em>connected</em>, and you want to easily
    navigate along those <em>connections</em>.
    So the <em>things</em> become the nodes and their <em>connections</em> the edges.
    For instance, think of a graph describing relationships between persons. Persons become the nodes and their
    relations become the edges:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala linenums">case class Person(name: String)

val g: Graph[Person, UnDiEdge[Person]] = ...
</pre>
<ol>
    <li>The node type.
    </li>
    <li value="3">A graph with node type <code>Person</code> and undirected edge type <code>UnDiEdge</code>.
        The predefined <code>UnDiEdge</code> suffices as long as you need a single type of relation between persons.
    </li>
</ol>
<p> Simple enough, why should we waste time worrying about nodes and edges that are self-evident?
    Well, because real life often leaves you with different options.
</p>
<p> Let's consider some options for modelling a database schema including
</p>
<ul>
    <li>tables with their columns</li>
    <li>indexes per table with a list of columns.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Intuitively, <em>Tables</em> and <em>columns</em> become nodes, edges represent which <em>columns</em> a
    <em>table</em> has.
    Next, what about <em>indexes</em>?
    <em>Indexes</em> could be modelled as another node type since they are kind of <em>things</em>, not just <em>connections</em>:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala linenums">sealed trait SchemaObject
case class Table(name: String)  extends SchemaObject
case class Column(name: String) extends SchemaObject
case class Index(name: String)  extends SchemaObject

val g: Graph[SchemaObject, DiEdge[SchemaObject]] = ...
</pre>
<ol>
    <li>The node ADT.</li>
    <li value="6">The predefined directed edge class <code>DiEdge</code> may point
        <ul>
            <li>from a table to the contained column or</li>
            <li>from an index to the contained column.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p> The above attempt has some deficiencies, though. First of all, there is no guarantee that nodes will be connected
    as expected.
    For instance, it is possible to add a directed edge from a column to an index.
    Such an arrow would result in a wrong set of adjacent nodes which should always be tables.
    Here is what we should prefer as a first improvement:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala linenums">// ... (node ADT unchanged)

sealed trait Relation
case class TableColumn(table: Table, column: Column)
    extends AbstractDiEdge(from = table, to = column)
    with Relation
case class IndexColumn(index: Index, column: Column)
    extends AbstractDiEdge(from = index, to = column)
    with Relation

val g: Graph[SchemaObject, Relation] = ...
</pre>
<ol>
    <li value="3">The ADT of edges.</li>
    <li>These edge types are now <em>typed</em> with respect to the source and target nodes.</li>
    <li value="7">
        Note that, unlike <code>DiEdge</code>, <code>Relation</code> has no type parameter.
        Hence, we call such a graph <em>typed graph</em>.
    </li>
</ol>
<p> Another drawback of the above design is that we missed relating indexes with tables.
    To overcome this issue in a property graph, you would use an edge labelled like <code>IndexTable</code>
    to be able to distinguish between arrows pointing to columns and arrows pointing to the table.
    Alternatively you could check that target node for its type.
    Keeping this in mind, let's move to the next drawback because once we get that resolved we also get rid of this
    <code>IndexTable</code> issue.
</p>
<p> You have probably noticed, that an <em>index</em> is existentially bound to a table what is proven by the fact that
    if you drop a table, the index needs be dropped as well.
    In terms of a graph it feels a little strange if a node needs be dropped on dropping another node.
    Would it be more viable to model an <em>index</em> as an edge?
</p>
<p> In fact, you can model <em>indexes</em> as hyperedges.
    In the <a
            href="https://github.com/scala-graph/scala-graph/blob/49912d57b4b70cec03c13c21c4e602376cc6765b/core/src/test/scala/demo/HyperADTDemo.scala#L73"
            target="_blank">database schema demo</a>
    we play around with this approach, including <code>Subset</code>,
    but to start with take a look at the following simplified version:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala linenums">sealed trait SchemaObject
case class Table(name: String)  extends SchemaObject
case class Column(name: String) extends SchemaObject

sealed trait Relation
case class TableColumn(table: Table, column: Column)
    extends AbstractDiEdge(from = table, to = column)
    with Relation
case class Index(table: Table, columns: OneOrMore[Column])
    extends AbstractDiHyperEdge(one(table), columns)
    with Relation

val g: Graph[SchemaObject, Relation] = ...
</pre>
<ol>
    <li>The ADT of nodes does not contain <code>Index</code> any more.</li>
    <li value="7">
        The edge type <code>Index</code> relates a table with a non-empty list of columns.
        <code>OneOrMore</code> is a data type supplied with <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em>.
        It represents a list of at least <code>one</code>
        while <code>Several</code> represents a list of at leas two elements.
        <code>OneOrMore</code> and <code>Several</code> facilitate type-safe hyperedges because
        a directed hyperedge has one or more sources and also one or more targets
        while a hyperedge has at least two ends.
    </li>
</ol>
<p> With this approach we have won the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Representing an <em>index</em> by a single directed hyperedge we got rid of unrelated directed edges per column
        that are much harder to maintain in a consistent way.
    </li>
    <li>It suffices to inspect this single directed hyperedge to get all information about a specific <em>index</em>.
        In comparison, with directed edges per column you need to programmatically collect related nodes first
        to get the same information.
    </li>
    <li>Once you remove a <em>table</em> from the graph, it's <em>indexes</em> will now be removed automatically.
    </li>
</ul>
<p> With hyperedges at your fingertips, don't hesitate to take advantage of them whenever they improve your design.
</p>

<h2 id="DirectedUndirected">Directed versus undirected</h2>
<p> If the relation you plan to represent is symmetrical go for undirected edges or undirected hyperedges.
    To test for symmetry, just read the relation from both sides:
    If you end up with the same phrase from both sides your relation is symmetrical.
    For instance, in a road net locations are symmetrical tested by
    "I can drive from location A to location B and, likewise, I can drive from location B to location A."
    Let`s deal with one-way roads below.
</p>
<p> As an example for asymmetrical relations, think of a person net that includes family as well as social relations.
    Then, <em>parenthood</em> is asymmetrical proven by "A is a parent of B and B is <b>not</b> a parent of A".
    B is rather a child of A.
    Also, assume you want to represent both <em>parenthood</em> and <em>children</em> in some way.
</p>
<p> For asymmetrical relations, different options are viable. Concerning our example you may
</p>
<ul>
    <li>use a directed edge for <em>parenthood</em> with the parent as the target.
        So you get the meaning depending on the direction you navigate.
        This assumes you can navigate into the opposite direction to get <em>children</em>
        what is supported by <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em>, of course.
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">case class Person(name: String)

sealed trait Relation
case class Parent(child: Person, parent: Person)
    extends AbstractDiEdge(from = child, to = parent)
    with Relation
// ...more relations

val g: Graph[Person, Relation] = ...
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>use separate directed edges for <em>parents</em> and <em>children</em>.
        In this approach both directed edges need be present or absent with respect to two specific persons.
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">sealed trait Relation
case class Parent(child: Person, parent: Person)
    extends AbstractDiEdge(from = child, to = parent)
    with Relation
case class Child(parent: Person, child: Person)
    extends AbstractDiEdge(from = parent, to = child)
    with Relation
// ...more relations
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>irrespective of the asymmetric nature of the relation, use an undirected edge
        with the first end being the <em>child</em> and the second end being the <em>parent</em>.
        Here we assume that you can filter edges during traversals like
        "to get parents, navigate along with an edge only if its second end is different from the node to navigate from".
        However, since this solution seems rather tricky, we do not find it outstanding.
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">sealed trait Relation
case class Parent(child: Person, parent: Person)
    extends AbstractUnDiEdge(child, parent)
    with Relation
// ...more relations
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>use directed hyperedges for <em>parents</em> and <em>children</em> alike.
        Thus, both getting parents and getting children are pretty straightforward
        compared with gathering relevant non-hyper edges.
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">sealed trait Relation
case class Parents(child: Person, mather: Person, father: Person)
    extends AbstractDiHyperedge(sources = one(child), targets = OneOrMore(mather, father))
    with Relation
case class Children(parent: Person, children: OneOrMore[Person])
    extends AbstractDiHyperedge(sources = one(parent), targets = children)
    with Relation
// ...more relations
        </pre>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Labelled">Labelled edges</h2>
<p> Most often you also need some edge label. Feel free to add any number of fields to your typed edge for this purpose.
    In terms of our above database schema example, we could add a "unique" property to the <code>Index</code> edge like:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">case class Index(table: Table, columns: OneOrMore[Column], unique: Boolean)
    extends AbstractDiHyperEdge(one(table), columns)
    with Relation
</pre>
<p> As a second example, we could extend the above <code>Parent</code> edge like
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">case class Parent(child: Person, parent: Person, `type`: ParenthoodType)
    extends AbstractDiEdge(from = child, to = parent)
    with Relation
</pre>
<p> with <code>ParenthoodType</code> being an enumeration like {Biological, Adoptive, Surrogate...}.
</p>
<p> In case you are still wondering, here is why we refrain from providing generic labelled edges:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Whenever you define a typed edge, what we recommend anyway, you may also add any number of labels in one go.
    </li>
    <li>Adding yet another type parameter for the label would increase complexity.
    </li>
    <li>With heterogeneous graphs in mind, typed edges are fully flexible with respect to different edge types.
        A type parameter for the label would only be a good pick for homogeneous graphs.
    </li>
    <li>With typed edges you can use proper names for your label fields.
        You don't need any redirection by an artificial field called <code>label</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Mixed">Mixed graphs</h2>
<p> You are free to mix any combination of directed, undirected and hyperedges in the same graph.
    Just look up the lowest common ancestor of your edge types in
</p>
<figure>
    <img alt="Edge Type Hierarchy"
         src="/img/guides/core/EdgeTypeHierarchy.jpg">
    <figcaption>Diagram: Edge Type Hierarchy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> and use the corresponding abstraction with the prefix <code>Any</code> like
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala linenums">sealed trait Relation extends AnyEdge[Person]

case class Parent(child: Person, parent: Person)
    extends AbstractDiEdge(from = child, to = parent)
    with Relation
case class Friends(one: Person, another: Person)
    extends AbstractUnDiEdge(one, another)
    with Relation

val g: Graph[Person, Relation] = ...
</pre>
<ol>
    <li><code>AnyEdge</code> is the lowest common ancestor of <code>DiEdge</code> and <code>UnDiEdge</code>.
    </li>
</ol>
<p> Mixed graphs work for generic and typed edges alike.
</p>

<h2 id="Multi">Multigraphs</h2>
<p> The previous example graph supporting edges of the type <code>Parent</code> or <code>Friends</code> works fine.
    You can connect two given <code>Person</code>s with a single edge or both <code>Parent</code> and <code>Friends</code>
    while you cannot connect them by more than one edge of the same type like <code>Friends</code>.
    This is the case because <code>AbstractDiEdge</code> and <code>AbstractUnDiEdge</code> apply a different built-in
    equality with respect to the same nodes. In specific,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>directed and undirected edges connecting the very same nodes never equal
    </li>
    <li>a directed edge with their nodes swapped is not equal to the original edge
    </li>
    <li>an undirected edge with their nodes swapped is equal to the original edge
    </li>
    <li>for hyperedges different strategies are supported.
    </li>
</ul>
<p> But what happens if we add yet another edge type?
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">case class Siblings(one: Person, another: Person)
    extends AbstractUnDiEdge(one, another)
    with Relation
</pre>
<p> Now <code>Friends</code> and <code>Siblings</code> have the same equality,
    so you will not be able to connect the same nodes by both edge types.
    To resolve this conflict mix in <code>MultiEdge</code> which serves to extend equality:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala linenums">case class Friends(one: Person, another: Person)
    extends AbstractUnDiEdge(one, another)
    with MultiEdge
    with Relation {
  def extendKeyBy = OneOrMore.one(Friends)
}
case class Siblings(one: Person, another: Person)
    extends AbstractUnDiEdge(one, another)
    with MultiEdge
    with Relation {
  def extendKeyBy = OneOrMore.one(Siblings)
}
</pre>
<ol>
    <li value="5">The mix-in <code>MultiEdge</code> requires <code>extendKeyBy</code> to be implemented.
        Defining a single constant key suffices here.
    </li>
    <li value="11">Same as with <code>Friends</code> but we need a different constant.
        Using constants ensures that you cannot connect two given <code>Person</code>s by the same edge type
        more than once.
    </li>
</ol>
<p> In contrast, whenever you need to allow for several edges of the same type between two given nodes
    you would implement <code>extendKeyBy</code> by referring to some discriminator value specific to edge instances.
    For instance, were you also keeping track of <code>Meeting</code>s between <code>Person</code>s,
    you could go with something like
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">case class Meeting(a: Person, b: Person, time: Datetime)
    extends AbstractUnDiEdge(a, b)
    with MultiEdge
    with Relation {
  def extendKeyBy = one(time)
}
</pre>
