<h1>Core User Guide: Initializing Graphs</h1>

<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p> The downloadable binaries are named
	<code>Graph-&lt;module&gt;_&lt;Scala-version&gt;-&lt;Graph-version&gt;.jar</code>
	following the Scala convention. For each <code>&lt;module&gt;</code> (here:
	<code>core</code>) there is a separate User Guide. To run the examples in the current
	documentation ensure that <code>Graph-core_*.jar</code> is on your class path.
</p>
<p>	In most cases you need to import the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">import scalax.collection.Graph // or scalax.collection.mutable.Graph
import scalax.collection.GraphPredef._, scalax.collection.GraphEdge._
</pre>

<h2>Type Parameters</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">trait Graph[N, E[X] <: EdgeLikeIn[X]]
</pre>
<p> <code>N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> is the type of the nodes of a graph instance.
</p>
<p> <code>E[X]</code> is the kind of type (also: higher kinded type) of edges of a graph
	instance.
</p>
<p> The trait <code>Graph</code> and most related templates have two type
	parameters: one for the contained nodes and one for the kind of contained edges.
	<code>Graph</code> doesn't impose any restriction on the type of nodes
	meaning that for the upper bound of the node type parameter any type
	including <code>Any</code> may be chosen. In contrast, the type parameter
	for edges is required to have at least the upper bound <code>EdgeLikeIn</code>.
</p>
<p> When selecting between the predefined edge types it might help
	you to understand their inheritance relationships:</p>
<figure>
	<img alt="Edge Type Hierarchy"
		src="/img/guides/core/EdgeTypeHierarchy.jpg">
	<figcaption>Diagram: Edge Type Hierarchy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> All edge classes derive from <code>trait EdgeLike</code> and, optionally, from
	<code>trait DiEdgeLike</code>. There are four <em>edge categories</em>:
	hyperedge, directed hyperedge, undirected and directed edge.
	Each of these categories has predefined edge classes representing any combination
	of non-weighted, weighted (<code>W</code>), key-weighted (<code>Wk</code>),
	labeled (<code>L</code>) and key-labeled (<code>Lk</code>).
	See <em>2.3 Edge Factories</em> for examples and more details.
</p>
<p> Based on the above inheritance hierarchy, graph types in the sense of
	graph theory are governed by the edge type parameter <code>E[X]</code>
	as follows:
</p>

	<tr><td>Multi</td>
		<td>One or more edge types with multi-edges</td>
		<td>any of the predefined edge classes containing <code>K</code> in its prefix
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p> There is no constraint on the node type, but you should be especially careful when
	designing mutable nodes: <code>equals</code>/<code>hashCode</code> must be constant
	over their lifetime. This is because the behavior of hash-based collections is not
	specified if the value of an element is changed in a manner that affects equals
	comparisons - see
	<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Map.html">
	java.util.Map</a>.
	(Having ill-designed mutable nodes, you are still able to find them in the graph
	by calling <code>find</code> or <code>filter</code>, but these calls will cause
	a full scan.)

<p> Edge factories are simply <code>apply</code> methods of companion objects
	of edge classes. They are typically called whenever an edge is passed to a
	<code>Graph</code> method as an argument. The above table contains factory
	examples for some of the predefined edge classes.
</p>
<p> Apart from the four basic edge classes <code>[Di]HyperEdge</code> and
	<code>[Un]DiEdge</code> there are plenty of convenience edge class
	variants enabling easy creation of weighted and/or labeled edges:

<p> To bring the predefined weighted or labeled edge classes and the
	corresponding shortcuts into scope you need additional <code>import</code>s,
	for instance
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum"
>import scalax.collection.edge.LDiEdge     // labeled directed edge
import scalax.collection.edge.Implicits._ // shortcuts
</pre>
<p> While simple directed and undirected edge shortcuts may be used without
	parenthesis like <code>1 ~&gt; 2</code>, weighted and/or labeled edge shortcuts
	implicitly map to calls of functions with two parameter lists thus requiring
	parenthesis like <code>(1 ~+&gt; 2)(x)</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="KeyedEdges">Multigraphs by keyed edges</h3>
<p>	Keyed edges (key-weighted and/or key-labeled edges) come into play
	whenever you are designing multigraphs.
	Upon edge insertion <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> checks for edge equality
	to ensure no duplicate exists in the edge set. Normally, edge equality is merely based
	on the edge endpoints.
	So to allow multiedges it is necessary to enhance edge equality by including
	additional attributes like a label. We denote such an edge `keyed`.
	For instance, <code>(n1 ~+> n2)(label_1)</code> is equal to <code>(n1 ~+> n2)(label_2)</code>
	while <code>(n1 ~+#> n2)(label_1)</code> is <em>not</em> equal to <code>(n1 ~+#> n2)(label_2)</code>.
	You need the latter, keyed edges to include both edges in a multigraph.  
</p>
<p> If your labels are of a compound type in the sense that they are made up of
	several attributes you should carefully analyze which parts of your
	labels ensure uniqueness because only those should become part of the edge key.
	Unless the edge key includes all parts of such a compound label type
	you need to override <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> to reflect the actual key parts.
	For instance, when designing a label type <code>Flight</code> for the predefined
	edge class <code>LkDiEdge</code>, you might observe, that only
	<code>flightNo</code> needs to be part of the edge key. Otherwise it would be
	possible to connect two airports with arcs showing to the same direction and
	with the same <code>flightNo</code> if the edges only differ in its
	<code>departure</code>. To cope with this problem you have to override
	<code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> as follows:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">case class Flight(flightNo : String,
                  departure: DayTime  = DayTime (0,0),
                  duration : Duration = Duration(0,0))
{ override def equals(other: Any) = other match {
    case that: Flight => (that.flightNo eq this.flightNo) ||
                          that.flightNo == this.flightNo
    case _            => false
  }
  override def hashCode = flightNo.##
}
</pre>
<p>	By the way, you can roughly achieve the same by defining your <code>case class</code>
	with two parameter lists. The difference is that you can only pattern-match and copy on
	the first parameter list:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">case class Flight(flightNo : String)(
                  val departure: DayTime  = DayTime (0,0),
                  val duration : Duration = Duration(0,0))
</pre>
<p> (The full example is included in <a href =
		"https://github.com/scala-graph/scala-graph/blob/master/core/src/test/scala/scalax/collection/TEdge.scala" 
		target="_blank">TEdge.scala</a>.)
</p>

<h3 id="LabeledEdges">Labeled edges</h3>
<p> Labeled edges contain a reference to a label object but the containing graph
	does not know about the actual label type. This is because edges of the same
	graph instance are allowed to have different types by design.
</p>
<p>	As a consequence, when using labeled edges you need to <code>match</code>
	against the label value. This conversion is supported by the
	<code>trait LEdgeImplicits[L]</code>:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">import scalax.collection.Graph
import scalax.collection.edge.LUnDiEdge
case class MyLabel(i: Int)
val outerEdge = LUnDiEdge(1,3)(MyLabel(4))
outerEdge.label.i // all right: 4
outerEdge.i       // compiler error

val g = Graph(outerEdge)           // Graph(1, 3, 1~3 'MyLabel(4))
g.edges.headOption map (_.label.i) // does not work either

// install implicit conversion for MyLabel 
import scalax.collection.edge.LBase.LEdgeImplicits
object MyImplicit extends LEdgeImplicits[MyLabel]; import MyImplicit._

outerEdge.i                        // all right: 4
g.edges.headOption map (_.label.i) // yep: Some(4)
g.edges.headOption map (_.i)       // you can even omit label
</pre>

<h3 id="HyperedgeEndpoints">Hyperedge equality</h3>
<p>	Looking at the endpoints of a hyperedge respectively the sources or targets of
	a directed hyperedge, equality is even more weird. For instance, would you say that
	<code>HyperEdge(1, 2, 2)</code> is equal to <code>HyperEdge(2, 2, 1)</code> or not?
	It turns out that depending on the use case both propositions may be desirable to hold.
</p>
<p>	<em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> currently supports two kinds of endpoint collections:
	<code>Bag</code> and <code>Sequence</code>. With <code>Bag</code> being the default kind,
	the above hyperedges are in fact equal. The endpoint collection kind is controled
	by an implicit value of the type <code>CollectionKind</code>.
	Define <code>Sequence</code> as an implicit value to turn this kind on:    
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">import scalax.collection.GraphEdge._
implicit val kind: CollectionKind = Sequence
HyperEdge(1, 2, 2) == HyperEdge(2, 2, 1) // false 
</pre>

<h3 id="EdgesCreationMethods">Bypassing edge factories</h3>
<p> What is more, mutable <code>Graph</code> instances provide edge creation methods
	to be called directly on <code>Graph</code> instances (<code>addEdge</code>,
	<code>+~=</code>, <code>addAndGetEdge</code>) or on inner nodes
	(<code>connectWith</code>, <code>+~</code>). These methods should save execution
	time since less conversion is necessary to complete edge creation.
</p>

<h2>Type Parameter Inference</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala linenums">val g = Graph()                // Graph[Nothing,Nothing]
val g = Graph(1)               // Graph[Int,Nothing]
val g = Graph(1~>2); g += 1.2  // Graph[Int,DiEdge]; compiler error
Graph(1~>2) + 2~3              // compiler error
</pre>
<p> Calling the default <code>Graph</code> factory without type parameters is in general
	satisfactory if at least one edge is passed. Otherwise, analogously to regular Scala
	collection members, you are advised to explicitly define the type parameters:
</p>
<p>As to</p>
<ol>
	<li>In absence of any arguments, <code>Nothing</code> is inferred for both the node
		and the edge type so you cannot add any nodes or edges to this instance later on.
	</li>
	<li>In absence of any edge arguments, <code>Nothing</code> is inferred for the
		edge type so you can add only nodes to this instance later on.
	</li>
	<li>To be able to add a <code>Double</code> to this instance, you must define
		its type parameters broader at creation time like <code>Graph[AnyVal,DiEdge]</code>.
		Also note that, due to the higher kinded nature of the <code>E[X]</code>
		type parameter, <code>DiEdge</code> is correctly inferred &#8211;
		even if some of you would expect <code>DiEdge[Int]</code>.
	</li>
	<li>This addition is rejected by the compiler because <code>[Int,DiEdge]</code>
		is inferred and <code>2~3</code> is not a directed but an undirected
		edge. Directed edges inherit from undirected edges but the opposite is
		not true.
	</li>
</ol>
<p> As a final note, whenever you are implementing own functionality on top
	of <code>Graph</code>, the Scala type system requires to declaratively
	maintain type parameter bounds as shown in the following example:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">def myFunction[N, E[X] <: EdgeLikeIn[X]](g: Graph[N,E])
