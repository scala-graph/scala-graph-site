<h1>Test Utilities</h1>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>	Thorough testing is inevitable to assure high quality when implementing your own
	use-case-specific or generic algorithms on top of <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em>.
	The package <code>scalax.collection.generator</code>, part of the module <code>graph-core</code>
	helps you to achieve this goal by providing facilities for user-friendly random graph generation.
</p>
<p>	Besides accepting a node generator, <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala Test</em>
	allows you to control the metrics of random graphs including their order,
	density and density distribution.
	Further, you control which edge types should connect nodes including custom weight
	and label generators.
</p>
<p>	The companion objects also provide some predefined generators such as
	<a href="http://www.scala-graph.org/api/core/api/index.html#scalax.collection.generator.GraphGen$"
	>smallConnectedIntDi</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="RandomGraphs">Creating Random Graphs</h2>
<p>	Think of <code>RandomGraph</code> as the native implementation to generate
	any kind of <code>Graph</code> with random nodes and edges satisfying user-defined
	graph metrics.
</p>

<h3>Obtaining Generators for Graphs with Predefined Metrics</h3>
<p>	The simplest way to obtain a random graph is to use a predefined generator like
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">import scalax.collection.generator._

val predefined = RandomGraph.tinyConnectedIntDi(Graph)
val tinyGraph = predefined.draw // Graph[Int,DiEdge]
</pre>

<h3>Setting individual graph metrics</h3>
<p>	You are certainly not stick with the metrics applied to predefined generators
	but you can adjust them individually:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala linenums">object sparse_1000_Int extends RandomGraph.IntFactory {
  val order = 1000
  val nodeDegrees = NodeDegreeRange(1,10)
  override def connected = false
}
val randomSparse = RandomGraph[Int,UnDiEdge,Graph](
    Graph, sparse_1000_Int, Set(UnDiEdge))
val sparseGraph = randomSparse.draw // Graph[Int,UnDiEdge]
</pre>
<p>As to</p>
<ol>
	<li>Defines the metrics for graphs of <code>Int</code> nodes.
	</li>
	<li>The generated graph will have an order of <code>1000</code>.
	</li>
	<li>Node degrees will be within the range of <code>1</code> and <code>10</code>.
	</li>
	<li>Allows the generated graph to be disconnected.
	</li>
	<li value="6">A <code>RandomGraph</code> generator is instantiated to generate
		graphs with the above metrics and the edge type <code>UnDiEdge</code>.  
	</li>
	<li value="8">Draws a concrete random graph from the generator.
	</li>
</ol>
	
<h3>Obtaining Generators for Individual Graph Types</h3>
<p>	As you have noticed the previous generator was restricted to the
	node type of <code>Int</code>. But to cover your use case you usually
	need to obtain random graphs with a specific node type. Let's define a
	class <code>Person(name: String, yearOfBirth: Int)</code> for this purpose.
	Also, let's create <code>PersonData</code> containing meaningful data
	to <code>Person</code>s:   
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">object PersonData {
  val firstNames = Set(
      "Alen", "Alice", "Bob", "Jack", "Jim",
      "Joe", "Kate", "Leo", "Tim", "Tom").to[Vector]
  val firstNamesSize = firstNames.size
   
  val surnames = Set(
      "Bell", "Brown", "Clark", "Cox", "King",
      "Lee", "Moore", "Ross", "Smith", "Wong").to[Vector]
  val surnamesSize = surnames.size
    
  def order = firstNamesSize * surnamesSize / 10
  def degrees = new NodeDegreeRange(2, order - 2)
  val maxYearOfBirth = 2010
}
</pre>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">import scalax.collection.edge.LDiEdge
  
case class Person(name: String, yearOfBirth: Int)
object Person {
  import PersonData._
  private val r = new scala.util.Random
      
  def drawFirstName: String = firstNames(r.nextInt(firstNamesSize))  
  def drawSurame: String = surnames(r.nextInt(surnamesSize))

  def drawName: String = s"$drawFirstName, $drawSurame"
      
  def drawYearOfBirth = maxYearOfBirth - r.nextInt(100)
}
 
val randomMixedGraph =
  RandomGraph[Person,UnDiEdge,Graph](
    Graph, new RandomGraph.Metrics[Person] {
      val order = PersonData.order
      val nodeDegrees = PersonData.degrees
      def nodeGen: Person = Person(Person.drawName, Person.drawYearOfBirth)
    },
    Set(UnDiEdge, LDiEdge)
)
val mixedGraph = randomMixedGraph.draw
</pre>
<p>	<code>mixedGraph</code> will now have undirected and labeled directed
	edges looking like
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">Graph(
  Person(Alice, Smith,1967),
  Person(Kate, Ross,1921),
  Person(Leo, Bell,2008),
  Person(Leo, Smith,1983),
  ...,
  Person(Alice, Smith,1967)~&gt;Person(Kate, Ross,1921) 'C,
  Person(Leo, Bell,2008)~Person(Leo, Smith,1983),
  ...
)
</pre>
<p>	You can even supply your own label and weight generators.
</p>

<h3>Keeping Metrics Constraints in Mind</h3>
<p>	You may wonder why we divided the number of all possible combinations of
	first names and surnames by 10. The reason is that <code>RandomGraph</code>
	must be able to draw distinct nodes. Ok, they become most probably distinct
	due to the presence of <code>yearOfBirth</code>. But had we just
	<code>Person(name: String)</code> and
	<code>def order = firstNamesSize * surnamesSize</code>, we'd get
	more and more duplicate names when drawing them.
	Therefore <code>RandomGraph</code> is implemented to cope with duplicates
	up to a certain limit. Above that limit the generator assumes that
	the supplied node generator behaves ill and rejects to generate the graph
	by throwing an exception. Otherwise it would take the risk of an infinite loop.       
</p>
<p>	In conclusion, always plan your node generator with respect to the graph order
	carefully. By rule of thumb, allow your node generator to have about ten-fold
	capacity over the graph order.
</p>
<p>	Node degrees are another important design aspect. Generating graphs
	with a high density may fail.
</p>

<h2 id="ScalaCheck">Integrating with <em>ScalaCheck</em></h2>
<p>	<code>GraphGen</code>, a thin wrapper around <code>RandomGraph</code>, is
	provided for out-of-the-box <code>ScalaCheck</code> integration.
	Below you'll find the <code>ScalaCheck</code> equivalent of the
	previous examples. We assume some knowledge of <code>ScalaCheck</code>. 
</p>

<h3>Obtaining <code>Arbitrary</code> Instances for Graphs with Predefined Metrics</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">type IntDiGraph = Graph[Int,DiEdge]
implicit val arbitraryTinyGraph = GraphGen.tinyConnectedIntDi[Graph](Graph)
  
val properTiny = forAll(arbitrary[IntDiGraph]) { g: IntDiGraph =&gt;
    g.order == GraphGen.TinyInt.order
}
properTiny.check
</pre>
     
<h3>Setting Individual Graph Metrics for <code>Arbitrary</code> Instances</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">object Sparse_1000_Int extends GraphGen.Metrics[Int] {
  val order = 1000
  val nodeDegrees = NodeDegreeRange(1,10)
  def nodeGen: Gen[Int] = Gen.choose(0, 10 * order)
  override def connected = false
}
  
type IntUnDiGraph = Graph[Int,UnDiEdge]
implicit val arbitrarySparseGraph = Arbitrary {
  GraphGen[Int,UnDiEdge,Graph](Graph, Sparse_1000_Int, Set(UnDiEdge)).apply
}
    
val properSparse = forAll(arbitrary[IntUnDiGraph]) { g: IntUnDiGraph =&gt;
  g.order == Sparse_1000_Int.order
}
properSparse.check
</pre>
    
<h3>Obtaining <code>Arbitrary</code> Instances to Generate Individual Graph Types</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">import scalax.collection.edge.LDiEdge
  
case class Person(name: String, yearOfBirth: Int)
object Person {
  import PersonData._
      
  def firstNameGen : Gen[String] = Gen.oneOf(firstNames)  
  def surameGen: Gen[String] = Gen.oneOf(surnames)

  def nameGen: Gen[String] = Gen.resultOf( (firstName: String, surname: String) =&gt;
    s"$firstName, $surname")(
    Arbitrary(firstNameGen), Arbitrary(surameGen))

  def yearOfBirthGen: Gen[Int] = Gen.choose(maxYearOfBirth - 100, maxYearOfBirth)
}
  
object MixedMetrics extends GraphGen.Metrics[Person] {
  val order = PersonData.order
  val nodeDegrees = PersonData.degrees
  def nodeGen: Gen[Person] = Gen.resultOf( (name: String, year: Int) =&gt;  
    Person(name, year))(
    Arbitrary(Person.nameGen), Arbitrary(Person.yearOfBirthGen))
}

type Mixed = Graph[Person,UnDiEdge]
implicit val arbitraryMixedGraph = Arbitrary {
  GraphGen[Person,UnDiEdge,Graph](
      Graph, MixedMetrics, Set(UnDiEdge, LDiEdge)).apply
}

val properMixedGraph = forAll(arbitrary[Mixed]) { g: Mixed =&gt;
  g.order == MixedMetrics.order
}
properMixedGraph.check
</pre>
  
<h3>Limiting the Minimum Number of Successful Test</h3>
<p>	As you know, by default <code>ScalaCheck</code> executes 100 tests
	before it takes your property proved. You may desire to limit the number
	of tests because, for instance, you are dealing with bigger graphs.
	Here is an example for how you can achieve this in the context of
	<code>ScalaTest</code>: 
</p>
 <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">import org.scalatest.{Matchers, Spec}
import org.scalatest.prop.PropertyChecks
    
class TGraphGenTest
    extends Spec with Matchers with PropertyChecks {
      
  implicit val config =
    PropertyCheckConfig(minSuccessful = 5, maxDiscarded = 5)
      
  object `generated Tiny graph` { 
    implicit val arbitraryTinyGraph =
      GraphGen.tinyConnectedIntDi[Graph](Graph)
          
    def `should conform to tiny metrics` {
      forAll(arbitrary[IntDiGraph]) { g: IntDiGraph =&gt;
        g.order should equal (GraphGen.TinyInt.order)
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre>
