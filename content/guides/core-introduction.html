<h1>Core User Guide: Introduction</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p> This document provides an example-driven, comprehensive coverage of the
	functionality of <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em>.
	In each chapter examples are listed first. You may then read the consecutive
	explanations or skip them and go directly to the next chapter.
</p>
<p> References to specific <code>Graph</code> classes in this document may be looked
    up in the Scaladoc API reference. This guide is not meant to be complete.
</p>
<p> For the sake of simplicity, most examples are based on graphs spanned
	over nodes of the type <code>Int</code>.
	<code>Graph</code> customization is shown by the node type <code>Airport</code>
	and the edge type <code>Flight</code>.
</p>

<h2>Why Use Graph for Scala?</h2>
<p> The most important reasons why <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> speeds up your
    development are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Creating, manipulating and
		querying <code>Graph</code> is intuitive.</li>
	<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> seamlessly
		maintains a consistent state of nodes and edges including prevention
		of duplicates, intelligent addition and removal.</li>
	<li><strong>Conformity</strong>: As a regular collection class, <code>Graph</code>
		has the same "look and feel" as other members of the Scala collection
		framework. Whenever appropriate, result types are Scala collection
		types themselves.</li>
	<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: All kinds of graphs including
		mixed graphs, multi-graphs and hypergraphs are supported.</li>
	<li><strong>Functional Style</strong>: <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em>
		facilitates a concise, functional style of utilizing graph
		functionality, including traversals, not seen in Java-based libraries.</li>
	<li><strong>Extendibility</strong>: You can easily customize
		<em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> to reflect the needs of you application
		retaining all benefits of <code>Graph</code>.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Ideal progress curve through
		adequate documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Look and see!

<p><em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> is designed for functional style programming
	meaning that you chain method calls as you feel inclined.
</p>

<h2>Modules</h2>
<p> The <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> library consists of the Core and
	further optional modules. Each module comes with its separate User
	Guide and is built as a separate Jar.
</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p> You are invited to request enhancements based on your problem domain.
