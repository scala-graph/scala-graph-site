<h1>Core User Guide: Introduction</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p> First released in 2011, <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> is intended to provide basic graph functionality
		with the look and feel of Scala Library collections.
		Graph editing, traversing and much more should be available at your fingerprint in a Scala-ish way.
</p>
<p> Note that graph instances live in memory with no direct relation to any database.
		However, serialization and deserialization are also supported.
</p>

<h2>Why Use Graph for Scala?</h2>
<p> Some important facts about why <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> might speed up your
    development are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>:
			Creating, manipulating and traversing graphs is intuitive.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Consistency</strong>:
			<em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> seamlessly maintains a consistent state of nodes and edges
			including duplicate element prevention, intelligent addition and removal.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Conformity</strong>:
			<em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> has the same look and feel as collections in the Scala Library.
			With result types being Scala collections themselves, you stay in the Scala universe.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>:
			Choose the best fit for your use case from a wide range of graph types
			also including mixed graphs, multi-graphs and hypergraphs.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Functional Style</strong>:
			<em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> facilitates a concise, functional style.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Documentation</strong>:
			Ideal progress curve through adequate documentation.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Look and see!
</p>

<h2>Modules</h2>
<p> The <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> library consists of the Core module and
	further optional modules with a separate User Guide each:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>DOT</strong>: supports export to DOT.
	</li>
	<li><strong>JSON</strong>: supports JSON serialization/deserialization
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Make adding algorithms easier.</li>
	<li>Reimplement immutable graphs based on a persistent data structure.</li>
</ol>
