<h1>Welcome to <span class="orange">scalax.collection.Graph</span></h1>
<p>	<em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> provides basic graph functionality that seamlessly fits
	into the Scala standard collections library. Like members of <code>scala.collection</code>,
	graph instances are in-memory containers that expose a rich, user-friendly interface.
</p>
<p>	Among others, <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em>
</p>
<ul><li>allows node and edge labels to be of any type
	</li>
	<li>provides a unified interface for any kind of graph including hypergraphs, mixed and multigraphs
	</li>
	<li>represents edges by classes, either predefined at library-side or user-defined and
	</li>
	<li>includes ready-to-go implementations of JSON-Import/Export and Dot-Export.
	</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
