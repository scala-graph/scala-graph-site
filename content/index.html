<h1>Welcome to <span class="orange">scalax.collection.Graph</span></h1>

<p> <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> provides basic graph functionality
		with the look and feel of Scala Library collections.
		Graph editing, traversing and much more is available at your fingerprint in a Scala-ish way.
</p>
<p>	Like the members of <code>scala.collection</code>, graph instances are in-memory containers
		that expose a rich, user-friendly interface.
</p>
<p>	Just for the records, the first version of <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> was published in 2011.
		Backed by the Scala core team, it started in the EPFL
		 <a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/scala-graph/wiki">Scala incubator space</a> that time.
</p>


<h2>Why Use Graph for Scala?</h2>
<p> Some important facts about how <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> helps to speed up your
	development are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>:
		Creating, manipulating and traversing graphs is intuitive,
		the graph interface is unified for all graph types.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Consistency</strong>:
		<em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> seamlessly maintains a consistent state of nodes and edges
		including duplicate element prevention, intelligent addition and removal.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Conformity</strong>:
		<em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> has the same look and feel as collections in the Scala Library.
		With result types being Scala collections themselves, you stay in the Scala universe.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>:
		<ul>
			<li>Label your nodes and edges without any restriction in a type safe way.</li>
			<li>Choose the best fit for your use case from a wide range of graph types also including mixed graphs, multi-graphs and hypergraphs.</li>
			<li>Find contained components.</li>
			<li>Walk from node to node.</li>
			<li>Supply your node or edge visitor to any traversal optionally.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Functional Style</strong>:
		<em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> facilitates a concise, functional style.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Documentation</strong>:
		Ideal progress curve through adequate user guides and detailed
		<h ref="http://www.scala-graph.org/api/core/api/#package" target="_blank">Scaladoc</h>.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Look and see!
