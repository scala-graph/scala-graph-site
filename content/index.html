<h1>Welcome to <span class="orange">scalax.collection.Graph</span></h1>
<p>
  <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> provides basic graph functionality that seamlessly fits
  into the Scala standard collections library. Like members of <code>scala.collection</code>,
  graph instances are in-memory containers that expose a rich, user-friendly interface.
</p>
<p>
  <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> also has ready-to-go implementations of JSON-Import/Export
  and Dot-Export. Database emulation and distributed graph processing are due to be supported.
</p>
<p>
  Backed by the Scala core team, <em id="G4S">Graph for Scala</em> started in 2011 as an open
  source project in the EPFL Scala incubator space on
  <a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/scala-graph/wiki">Assembla</a>.
  Meanwhile it is also hosted on <a href="https://github.com/scala-graph/scala-graph"
  target="_blank">Github</a>.
